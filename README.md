# My Notes Repository

Welcome to my **Notes Repository**! This repository is a collection of my personal notes, organized and stored in Markdown format. It serves as a central place to document my learning journey, ideas, and references across various topics.

## Structure
The repository is neatly organized into directories based on subject or category, making it easy to navigate and find specific content. Each note is written in Markdown (`.md`) for readability and accessibility.

I follow Kepano's File over App philosophy so all my notes are stored in a easily accessible format that can be used with any app that can render markdown files. Folders that consist of many different courses and are part of a program will have an index note in the folder and single course folder won't.
