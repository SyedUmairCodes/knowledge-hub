# Hello World

- Print the text "Hello World!" in Python

```Python
print("Hello World!")
```

The text in the cells above that starts with the # hash or pound symbol is a comment line. It tells Python that it can ignore anything that follows on that line after the # symbol. Comments are used to help other humans understand what your code does.
