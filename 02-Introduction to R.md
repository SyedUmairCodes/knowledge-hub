What is R? R is a programming language and environment specifically designed for statistical analysis and graphics1. It is a popular language in data science, and it is free to use. R's extensive functionality is due to its large community of users that develop and share packages. R can be used for various tasks, such as making websites, maps, and analyzing language1.

Installing R: The document provides step-by-step instructions for installing R on both Windows and Mac operating systems. It emphasizes downloading R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)1. The instructions cover the various prompts that will appear during the installation process, such as the destination location for the program, and options for creating shortcuts.

●

RStudio: RStudio is a graphical user interface (GUI) for R, and it provides a user-friendly environment for writing, editing, and storing code, as well as generating and viewing plots and managing files2. The installation process for RStudio on both Windows and Mac operating systems is also detailed, including downloading the correct installer for the operating system.

●

RStudio Interface: The RStudio interface is divided into four quadrants: the source panel, the console, the environment/history panel, and the files/plots/packages/help panel3. The document explains the main menu bar and its functions, including the file, session, and tools menus. It covers the functionality of each quadrant, including writing and executing code in the console, viewing data and objects in the environment panel, saving code in the source panel, and viewing plots, installed packages, and help files in the bottom-right quadrant3.

●

R Packages: The document discusses R packages, which are collections of functions, data, and code that extend the functionality of base R4. The document explains that packages are developed and published by the R community and are available on repositories such as CRAN, Bioconductor, and GitHub4. The document details how to install, load, update, and uninstall packages, including the use of the install.packages(), library(), update.packages(), and remove.packages() functions567. It also describes the process for finding packages, including using CRAN task views, R documentation, and online searches45.

●

Using Packages: Once a package is installed, its functions must be loaded using the library() function6. Help pages and vignettes provide guidance on how to use a package's functions8. The help files can be accessed in the console or through the Packages tab in RStudio8. The document also mentions that the command sessionInfo() will output information on the version of R being used and the packages that are loaded, which can be useful for troubleshooting8.

●

R Projects: R projects are a way to organize work in R and keep all related files together9. A project creates a folder that serves as the working directory, and it remembers which files were open when the project was closed, restoring the work environment9. The document describes how to create a new project, open an existing project, and set up project directories for data, scripts, and output9.

R Markdown: R Markdown is a method for creating reproducible documents that combine text and code10. R Markdown documents can be rendered into various formats, such as HTML, PDF, Word documents, and slides. The document covers the basics of R Markdown, including the header, text sections, and code chunks. The document includes instructions on how to format text with bolding and italics, create section headers, and insert code chunks10. The document also encourages the reader to check out the R Markdown cheat sheet for more information10.
