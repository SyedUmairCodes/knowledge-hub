The evolution of database technology has progressed through four main generations, each with distinct characteristics and capabilities.
●
First-generation systems (1960s) focused on sequential and random file searching, requiring users to write detailed computer programs for data access. These were essentially file processing systems, managing only one entity type. They lacked standards and offered limited support for relating data.
●
Second-generation systems (1970s) were the first true DBMSs, capable of managing multiple entity types and relationships. However, access still required writing computer programs to navigate through linked records. Some products adhered to the CODASYL standard, but IBM, a major computer company at the time, did not. IBM supported a different approach using the hierarchical data model.
●
Third-generation systems (1980s) are known as relational DBMSs, based on mathematical relations and operators. They introduced non-procedural languages, allowing users to specify what data to retrieve without needing to code complex procedures. Optimization technology ensured efficient access. IBM played a vital role in commercializing relational database technology, and SQL became a widely accepted standard.

Fourth-generation systems (1990s-2010s) expanded database technology to include unconventional data types such as images, videos, maps, and web data. They used the Extensible Markup Language (XML) as a publishing standard. These systems are sometimes called object-relational or object-oriented. They also support data warehousing, cloud computing, and the processing of big data. These systems can handle semi-structured data. These systems have new features to support business intelligence processing for data integration and use of summary data.
The evolution of DBMSs has also been marked by the development of features like nonprocedural access. Nonprocedural languages, like SQL, allow users to specify what data they want to retrieve instead of how to retrieve it. This significantly reduces the amount of code required and improves software productivity. Nonprocedural languages do not include looping statements, as users specify what parts of the database to retrieve without needing to write complex loops.
Additionally, Database Management Systems have evolved to provide a broad range of features for data acquisition, storage, dissemination, maintenance, retrieval and formatting
