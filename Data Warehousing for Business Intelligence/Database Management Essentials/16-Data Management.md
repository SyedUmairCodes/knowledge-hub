Introduction to Databases
2 sources
This text is a series of lectures introducing database management systems (DBMS). It covers fundamental database concepts, such as data vs. information, essential database characteristics (persistence, interrelatedness, shared access), and different user roles. The lectures also explain the differences between DBMS and standard desktop software, focusing on database definition and planning. Finally, it explores advanced topics, including database transactions, business intelligence (BI) processing, and the historical evolution of DBMS technology, highlighting key advancements across different generations of DBMS products.

Explain databases and database management systems, what are the characteristics of databases and database management systems

A database is a collection of persistent, interrelated, and shared data. Database Management Systems (DBMS) are collections of components that support the creation, use, and maintenance of databases.
Key characteristics of databases:
‚óè
Persistent: Data resides on stable storage like magnetic disks, which allows for repetitive use. Data is retained throughout its lifecycle but can be removed or archived when no longer relevant.
‚óè
Interrelated: Data stored in separate units are connected to provide a comprehensive picture. Databases store entities and the relationships between these entities.
‚óè
Shared: Databases are shared by many applications and users simultaneously.
Key features of DBMSs:
‚óè
Database definition: Includes tools for defining entity types, relationships, integrity constraints, and authorization rights. This is a feature that distinguishes DBMS from desktop software like word processors and spreadsheets. Planning is essential for databases, even small ones, and an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) should be developed before implementation.
‚óè
Nonprocedural access: Allows users with limited computing skills to submit queries. Users specify what data to retrieve, not how to retrieve it. This is considered the most important feature because it allows access without detailed coding.
‚óè
Application development: Offers graphical tools to develop menus, data entry forms, and reports.
‚óè
Procedural language interface: Combines nonprocedural access with the full capabilities of a programming language, such as Java or Javascript.
‚óè
Transaction processing: Includes control mechanisms to prevent interference from simultaneous users and to recover lost data after a failure.
‚óè
Database tuning: Provides tools to monitor and improve database performance.
‚óè
Data acquisition, storage, dissemination, maintenance, retrieval, and formatting: DBMS have evolved to provide a wide range of features for these tasks.
DBMS products can be categorized as:
‚óè
Enterprise DBMSs designed to support large databases with many simultaneous users. They have strong reliability and performance requirements and typically run on powerful servers. Oracle is a leading provider of enterprise database products.
‚óè
Desktop DBMSs that support small workgroups with smaller databases and modest reliability. Microsoft Access dominates this market.
‚óè
Embedded DBMSs are sold as part of an application and are hidden from users.
The evolution of database technology has resulted in four generations of products:
‚óè
First-generation: Supported sequential and random searching, requiring detailed computer programs to access data.
‚óè
Second-generation: True database management systems that managed multiple entity types and relationships. Still required computer programs to access data, also known as navigational systems because the programmer had to write code to navigate linked records.
‚óè
Third-generation: Relational DBMSs based on mathematical relations, with optimization technology to enable efficient access using non-procedural language. IBM was a pioneer in the development of this technology.
‚óè
Fourth-generation: Extended database technology to unconventional data such as images, videos, and web data, also known as object relational or object-oriented systems. They feature convenient ways to publish static and dynamic web data.
In addition, recent innovations include:
‚óè
Cloud computing: Supports on-demand access to data and software, a new area of product development for established and new DBMS vendors.
‚óè
NoSQL: Developed to deal with the challenges of big data and stands for "not only SQL", which provides alternative technologies to SQL.
What is SQL

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is an industry-standard database language used for database definition, manipulation, and control. SQL is a non-procedural language that allows users to specify what data to access, rather than how to access it. This means that users do not need to write complex procedures with loops to retrieve data.
Here are some key aspects of SQL:
‚óè
Non-procedural Access: SQL is designed to allow users to access data without needing to code complex procedures. Non-procedural languages, like SQL, do not include looping statements because the user specifies the parts of a database to access.
‚óè
Standard Language: SQL is supported by most DBMSs and is considered an industry standard.
‚óè
Versatile: SQL includes statements for database definition, manipulation, and control.
‚óã
Database Definition: SQL is used to define tables, relationships among tables, integrity constraints, and authorization rights. The CREATE TABLE statement is an example of a database definition statement.
‚óã
Database Manipulation: SQL statements like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE are used to manipulate data within a database.
‚óã
Database Control: SQL has statements such as GRANT and REVOKE that are used to control access to data.
‚óè
Query Formulation: SQL is used to formulate queries, which are requests for data to answer a question. The SELECT statement is a primary tool for non-procedural database access.
‚óè
Stand-alone and Embedded Usage: SQL can be used in stand-alone mode, where users submit SQL statements with a specialized editor, or in embedded mode, where SQL statements are included in a computer program.
‚óè
Evolution of SQL: SQL began as the SQUARE language in IBM's System R project, later becoming SEQUEL, and eventually SQL due to legal issues.
SQL is a crucial tool for database professionals, especially power users and information systems professionals, as it enables efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Understanding SQL is fundamental to working with databases and developing database applications.
Explain procedural and non-procedural access in a database

Procedural access and non-procedural access are two different ways of interacting with a database, particularly in how data is retrieved.
Procedural Access:
‚óè
Procedural access requires a user to write detailed computer programs that specify how to navigate through the database to access the data. This involves writing code with loops and other complex procedural logic.
‚óè
In early DBMSs, there was a close connection between a database and computer programs that accessed the database. Essentially, the DBMS was considered part of a programming language.
‚óè
Second-generation database systems were "navigational," meaning programmers had to write code to navigate among a network of linked records.
‚óè
Procedural access involves coding complex procedures with loops.
‚óè
Procedural languages have statements like "for" and "while" for looping.
Non-Procedural Access:
‚óè
Non-procedural access allows users to specify what data to retrieve, rather than how to retrieve it.
‚óè
Users do not need to write complex procedures with loops.
‚óè
Non-procedural languages do not have looping statements.
‚óè
Non-procedural access reduces the amount of code needed by a factor of 100 compared to procedural access.
‚óè
The standard tool for non-procedural access is the SQL SELECT statement.
‚óè
Most DBMSs provide an SQL client to enter and execute SQL statements.
‚óè
Many DBMSs also offer graphical tools to access databases, where users indicate the required tables, relationships, and columns, and the system generates the plan to retrieve the data.
Key Differences Summarized:
Feature
Procedural Access
Non-Procedural Access
Focus
Specifies how to retrieve data

Coding
Requires complex procedures with loops
Does not require complex procedures with loops
User Skill
Requires detailed programming skills
Users with limited computing skills can use it
Language

Uses languages without looping statements
Code Volume
Larger volume of code
Significantly reduced code volume
Example
Navigating through linked records using code
SQL SELECT statements or graphical query tools
Importance of Non-Procedural Access:
‚óè
Increased Productivity: Non-procedural access dramatically improves software productivity because a large part of business software involves data access.
‚óè
Ease of Use: It allows users with limited technical skills to retrieve data.
‚óè
Application Development: Non-procedural access facilitates form and report creation without extensive coding, allowing users to specify data requirements through SQL or graphical tools.
‚óè
Query Formulation: Non-procedural access is a crucial feature of a DBMS, making query formulation a fundamental skill for database work, especially for power users and information systems professionals.
‚óè
Reduced Coding: Non-procedural access reduces coding requirements related to data retrieval by a factor of 100.
In essence, non-procedural access, particularly through SQL, has revolutionized how users interact with databases, making it more accessible, efficient, and productive than procedural access. While procedural languages remain important for complex applications, non-procedural access is a cornerstone of modern database management.
Explain transaction processing

Transaction processing is a critical function of a Database Management System (DBMS) that ensures the reliable and efficient processing of large volumes of repetitive work. It involves a collection of operations that must be processed as one unit of work. The DBMS provides services to ensure that transactions are processed correctly without interference from concurrent users and without loss of data due to failures.
Here's a breakdown of key concepts related to transaction processing:
‚óè
Definition of a Transaction:
‚óã
A transaction is a user-defined concept, meaning that the user specifies which operations are part of a transaction. For example, a bank transaction might involve debiting one account and crediting another.
‚óã
It is a unit of work that should be processed reliably. A transaction can include any number of reads and writes to a database.
‚óã
Transactions are defined using SQL statements such as START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK.
‚óè
ACID Properties: Transactions must adhere to the ACID properties:
‚óã
Atomicity: A transaction is indivisible; either all operations succeed, or none do. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back to its previous state.
‚óã
Consistency: A transaction must maintain the database's integrity. If the database is in a consistent state before the transaction, it must also be in a consistent state after the transaction.
‚óã
Isolation: Transactions must operate independently of each other. Concurrent transactions should not interfere with each other.
‚óã
Durability: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and will survive system failures.
‚óè
Transparency: DBMSs provide two types of transparency to ensure the ACID properties:
‚óã
Recovery transparency: The DBMS automatically restores the database to a consistent state after a failure.
‚óã
Concurrency transparency: The DBMS ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
‚óè
Concurrency Control:
‚óã
Concurrency control is essential to manage multiple users accessing and modifying the same data concurrently.
‚óã
It prevents interference among concurrent transactions.
‚óã
The objective of concurrency control is to maximize transaction throughput while ensuring data integrity.
‚óã
Concurrency control uses techniques such as locking to manage concurrent access and prevent issues like lost updates, uncommitted dependencies, and non-repeatable reads.
‚óã
The Two-Phase Locking (2PL) protocol is a common method to ensure that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
‚óè
Recovery Management:
‚óã
Recovery management is the process of restoring a database to a consistent state after a failure.
‚óã
This involves using tools such as logs, checkpoints, and backups to recover from failures.
‚óã
Recovery ensures that no data is lost due to system crashes or other failures.
‚óè
Transaction Design:
‚óã
Proper transaction design is crucial for performance.
‚óã
Design decisions include determining transaction boundaries, managing hot spots (frequently accessed data), and setting isolation levels.
‚óã
A key goal in transaction design is to minimize the duration of transactions.
‚óè
Examples of Transactions:
‚óã
Making an airline reservation.
‚óã
Withdrawing cash from an ATM.
‚óã
Placing an order in an online shopping system.
‚óã
Registering for a course.
Transaction processing is fundamental to the daily operations of many organizations, including banks, airlines, and universities, and its importance is continually growing with the rise of electronic commerce and mobile computing.
Transaction processing is also contrasted with business intelligence processing, which utilizes data warehouses with historical data to support strategic decision-making, while transaction processing relies on operational databases with current data at the individual level for daily operations.
How do third-party features help databases

Third-party software provides additional features that extend the capabilities of Database Management Systems (DBMS). These features can enhance database functionality in various ways, sometimes competing directly with the tools provided by the DBMS vendor.
Here's how third-party features help databases:
‚óè
Advanced Database Design Tools: Many third-party vendors offer advanced design tools that enhance the database definition and tuning capabilities already provided by DBMSs. These tools might offer features for creating sophisticated diagrams, performing detailed analysis, and generating documentation for a database design. For example, Visio Professional is a third-party tool that can be used for database design. CASE (Computer-Aided Software Engineering) tools are used to help with database development, with front-end tools for diagramming and back-end tools for generating code and prototypes. Aqua Data Studio is another example of a commercial CASE tool.
‚óè
Application Development Tools: Third-party vendors also provide application development tools that can be used instead of the tools provided by the DBMS. This allows organizations to select the application development tools that best suit their needs, potentially offering more advanced features or easier-to-use interfaces.
‚óè
Extended Functionality: Third-party software can offer features that go beyond the standard capabilities of a DBMS. This can include specialized tools for tasks like data integration, data quality, or data warehouse management.
‚óè
Specialized Features: Third-party software often provides specialized tools for specific tasks such as database design, performance tuning, and application development.
‚óè
Alternative Tools: In some instances, third-party software can compete directly with the database product, offering alternative tools for functions such as application development.
‚óè
Data Modeling Tools: Third-party data modeling tools offer capabilities for creating diagrams and models of the database.
‚óè
Database Tuning: Some third-party tools extend database tuning capabilities.
By providing these diverse tools and features, third-party vendors enable organizations to customize and enhance their database environments to meet specific requirements. Third-party software extends the features available with the database software and helps organizations tailor their databases to specific needs.

explain the evolution of databases

The evolution of database technology has progressed through four main generations, each with distinct characteristics and capabilities.
‚óè
First-generation systems (1960s) focused on sequential and random file searching, requiring users to write detailed computer programs for data access. These were essentially file processing systems, managing only one entity type. They lacked standards and offered limited support for relating data.

explain the architecture of DBMS and the three schema architecture

Database Management Systems (DBMS) architectures can be understood through two main frameworks: the Three Schema Architecture and architectures supporting parallel and distributed processing.
Three Schema Architecture
This architecture, depicted in Figure 1.12, was proposed in the mid-1970s as a way to achieve data independence. Data independence means that a database should have an identity separate from the applications (computer programs, forms, and reports) that use it. This separation allows changes to the database definition without affecting related applications. The architecture includes three levels of database description, known as schemas:
‚óè
External Level: This is the user level, where each group of users can have a separate external view (or view) of the database tailored to their specific needs. These views are often application-specific, representing the data required for a particular form or report.
‚óè
Conceptual Level: This level defines the entity types and relationships for the entire database. It represents the logical meaning of the database and can be quite large for a business database.
‚óè
Internal Level: This represents the storage view of the entire database, describing how the data is physically stored. This level defines the files and collections of data on a storage device, such as a hard disk.
The three schema levels ensure data independence through mappings between them. Applications typically access a database using a view. The DBMS transforms an application‚Äôs request from the external view to the conceptual schema, and then to the internal schema. Most changes to the conceptual or internal schema do not affect applications because they do not directly use the lower schema levels. The DBMS is responsible for using mappings to make transformations.
The Three Schema Architecture is an official standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). However, the specific details of the standard were never widely adopted. Instead, the standard serves as a guideline about data independence. The spirit of the Three Schema Architecture is widely implemented in third- and fourth-generation DBMSs.
Other Architectures
‚óè
Client-Server Architectures: These architectures divide processing capabilities between a client and a server. The client typically handles the user interface, while the server manages the database. There can be multiple tiers, where the client interacts with a middleware server, which then interacts with a database server. Web services extend these architectures for electronic business commerce.
‚óè
Parallel Database Processing: These architectures utilize tightly-coupled computing resources to improve performance and availability. They can be implemented using shared disk or shared nothing approaches. In shared disk systems, the processors share all disks but nothing is shared across clusters. In shared nothing architectures, processors share no resources, but each cluster works in parallel to perform a task.
‚óè
Distributed Database Processing: This approach allows geographically dispersed computers to cooperate when providing data access. Distributed databases provide local control and reduce communication costs by locating data where it is most frequently used. These architectures can be tightly or loosely integrated, depending on the homogeneity of the local DBMSs.
Cloud-Based Database Architecture
Cloud computing provides a new approach to database management without initial product licensing costs and hosting requirements. Using web-based interfaces, organizations can design and deploy databases with dynamic resource allocation provided by the cloud. The internal details of the cloud are invisible to organizations using the cloud service.
In summary, the Three Schema Architecture provides a framework for data independence through its separation of external, conceptual, and internal views. The other architectures like client-server, parallel, and distributed systems, address performance and access in networked environments. Cloud-based database architectures provide a new approach for managing databases by reducing licensing costs and hosting requirements.
Explain data independence

Data independence is a key concept in database management, referring to the idea that a database should have an identity that is separate from the applications (computer programs, forms, and reports) that use it. This separation is crucial because it allows for changes to the database definition without requiring modifications to related applications.
Here's a breakdown of what data independence entails:
‚óè
Separation of Concerns: Data independence ensures that the conceptual meaning of a database is not mixed with its physical implementation or the programs that access it. This separation simplifies database management and software maintenance.
‚óè
Reduced Maintenance Costs: By separating the database definition from applications, database specialists can experiment with performance tuning without impacting computer programs. For instance, adding a new column to a table should not affect applications that do not use that column. Similarly, changes to physical storage should not necessitate changes to applications.
‚óè
Flexibility and Adaptability: Data independence enables changes to the database structure or implementation without disrupting the applications that rely on the database. This flexibility is essential for adapting to changing business needs.
‚óè
Three Schema Architecture: The concept of data independence led to the proposal of the Three Schema Architecture, which includes the external, conceptual, and internal levels, each serving a different function. This architecture enables the transformation of data requests between different levels, maintaining data independence.
‚óè
Mappings: The DBMS uses mappings to transform application requests from the external view to the conceptual schema and then to the internal schema. This process ensures that applications are not directly dependent on the physical storage details of the database.
In essence, data independence means that changes to the database structure or storage can be made without impacting the applications, forms, and reports that access the data. This separation of concerns makes database management more efficient and less costly. The Three Schema Architecture facilitates this by providing different levels of abstraction, where applications interact at the external level and are shielded from the details of the conceptual and internal levels. This separation is crucial for ensuring that a database can evolve over time without requiring extensive and costly changes to the applications that depend on it.
explain parallel and distributed processing in depth

Parallel and distributed processing are two methods of utilizing multiple computing resources to improve performance and availability, but they differ significantly in their approach and goals.
Parallel Database Processing
‚óè
Definition: Parallel database processing divides a large task into smaller tasks and distributes these among interconnected computers to improve performance. It focuses on using multiple resources (processors, disks, and memory) to perform a single task faster. This is often done using tightly coupled resources with high-speed networks.
‚óè
Goals: The primary goals are to achieve speedup (performing a task faster) and scaleup (performing more work in the same time). It also aims to increase availability by dynamically adjusting to the level of available resources.
‚óã
Speedup is about completing a single task more quickly by using more resources.
‚óã
Scaleup is about increasing the amount of work completed by increasing computing capacity while holding completion time constant. For ideal linear scaleup, increasing computing capacity n times allows completion of n times the amount of work in the same time.
‚óè
Architectures: Common architectures include:
‚óã
Shared Disk (SD): Each processor has its own memory, but the processors share access to all disks.
‚óã
Shared Nothing (SN): Each processor has its own memory and disks. Data must be partitioned among the processors.
‚óã
Clustered Disk (CD): Processors in each cluster share all disks, but nothing is shared across clusters.
‚óã
Clustered Nothing (CN): Processors in each cluster share no resources, but each cluster can be manipulated to work in parallel.
‚óè
Implementation: Parallel DBMSs are designed to use a collection of resources in parallel. They use high-speed networks and storage systems to coordinate work among resources.
‚óè
Transparency: Resource sharing is typically transparent to applications. Application code (SQL and programming language statements) does not need to be changed to take advantage of parallel processing.
‚óè
Challenges: Load balancing (evenly distributing work among processors), cache coherence (maintaining data consistency across multiple caches), and interprocessor communication (synchronizing actions of independent processors) are key challenges.
‚óè
Commercial examples include Oracle Real Application Clusters using the CD architecture and IBM DB2 with the DPF option using the CN architecture.
‚óè
Big Data: Parallel processing is also crucial for handling big data. Tools like Hadoop, MapReduce, Spark, and Hawq enable parallel processing of large, unstructured datasets that are not well-suited to traditional DBMS queries.
Distributed Database Processing
‚óè
Definition: Distributed processing involves the distribution of tasks and data among computers connected by a network. It focuses on enabling different sites to cooperate in providing access to data. It is used to allow local control of data, reduce communication costs, and improve performance.
‚óè
Goals: The primary goals are to provide local control of data, reduce communication costs by locating data closer to where it‚Äôs used, and improve performance by allowing multiple sites to work concurrently. Increased data availability is another goal.
‚óè
Architecture: A distributed database has a component architecture composed of local data managers (LDM) at each site, and a distributed data manager (DDM) that manages global requests. The schema architecture includes a global conceptual schema and local schemas for each site.
‚óè
Implementation: Distributed database systems must manage data that are located at different network sites. These systems must handle global requests (queries or transactions that access data at multiple sites).
‚óè
Tightly vs. Loosely Integrated Systems: Tightly integrated systems have homogeneous local DBMSs which allow for more efficient processing of distributed queries and transactions. Loosely integrated systems support data sharing among a mix of modern and legacy DBMSs.
‚óè
Transparency: Transparency refers to the visibility (or invisibility) of the internal details of a service. Levels of transparency include:
‚óã
Fragmentation Transparency: Users can write queries without knowledge of how the data is divided into fragments.
‚óã
Location Transparency: Users do not need to know the physical locations of the data.
‚óã
Local Mapping Transparency: Users are aware of the site names but do not need to know how data are fragmented within each site.
‚óè
Challenges: Distributed database design is complex. Poor design can lead to higher communication costs and poor performance. Distributed transaction processing can add significant overhead, especially for replicated data. Security is a major concern, as multiple sites must be protected from unauthorized access.
‚óè
Query Processing: Distributed query processing involves both local and global optimization, and it must take data movement and site selection into account.
‚óè
Transaction Processing: Distributed transaction processing ensures the ACID properties but introduces new challenges like coordinating across independent sites and handling network failures.
Key Differences
‚óè
Autonomy: Distributed databases provide site autonomy, while parallel databases do not. Autonomy means that each site has local control over its data and operations.
‚óè
Focus: Parallel processing focuses on speeding up a single task by using multiple processors. Distributed processing focuses on allowing multiple sites to cooperate, often for local control and reduced communication costs.
‚óè
Complexity: Distributed databases introduce added complexities like handling data replication and ensuring consistency across multiple sites. Parallel databases focus on optimizing performance in a more tightly controlled environment.

Explain client-server and cloud based architecture

Client-server architecture is a way of organizing components (clients and servers) among computers connected by a network. This arrangement supports efficient processing of messages or requests for service between clients and servers. It's a foundational concept for distributed processing, where complex work is divided into more manageable units.
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of key aspects:
‚óè
Basic Components:
‚óã
Clients: Programs that make requests to servers. Clients can be PCs or other devices.
‚óã
Servers: Programs that perform requests and send results back to clients. Servers can be database servers, application servers or web servers, and may use middleware.
‚óè
Division of Processing: Client-server architecture divides tasks between clients and servers, such as presentation, validation, and business logic. Some tasks can be performed locally on a client, while others are performed remotely on a server.
‚óè
Middleware: Middleware is software that manages communication and processing between clients and servers, supporting interoperability and efficient message control. Middleware can handle tasks such as queuing, scheduling, and routing of messages.
‚óè
Types of Architectures:
‚óã
Two-Tier Architecture: A PC client interacts directly with a database server. The client contains the presentation code and SQL statements, while the server processes SQL and manages data. Often called "fat clients" due to the amount of business logic on the client.
‚óã
Three-Tier Architecture: An additional server layer is added, such as a middleware server for process management or an application server for specific processing tasks. This architecture improves performance by reducing the load on the database server.
‚óã
Multiple-Tier Architecture: Supports additional layers of servers for flexible division of processing, as seen in web-based applications.
‚óè
Advantages:
‚óã
Flexibility: The system is easier to maintain and adapt because code can be isolated.
‚óã
Scalability: It supports adding or removing capacity in small increments, both on the server (vertical scalability) and client sides (horizontal scalability).
‚óã
Interoperability: Allows communication across different platforms.
‚óè
Disadvantages:
‚óã
Complexity: Developing client-server software can be complex due to architectural choices.
‚óã
Cost: Can have high development costs.
