# Transaction Processing
Transaction processing is a critical function of a Database Management System (DBMS) that ensures the reliable and efficient processing of large volumes of repetitive work. It involves a collection of operations that must be processed as one unit of work. 

The DBMS provides services to ensure that transactions are processed correctly without interference from concurrent users and without loss of data due to failures.

A transaction is a user-defined concept, meaning that the user specifies which operations are part of a transaction. For example, a bank transaction might involve debiting one account and crediting another.

It is a unit of work that should be processed reliably. A transaction can include any number of reads and writes to a database. Transactions are defined using SQL statements such as START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK.

Transactions must adhere to the ACID properties:

- Atomicity: A transaction is indivisible; either all operations succeed, or none do. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back to its previous state.
- Consistency: A transaction must maintain the database's integrity. If the database is in a consistent state before the transaction, it must also be in a consistent state after the transaction.
- Isolation: Transactions must operate independently of each other. Concurrent transactions should not interfere with each other.
- Durability: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and will survive system failures.

DBMSs provide two types of transparency to ensure the ACID properties:

- Recovery transparency: The DBMS automatically restores the database to a consistent state after a failure.
- Concurrency transparency: The DBMS ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.

Concurrency control is essential to manage multiple users accessing and modifying the same data concurrently. It prevents interference among concurrent transactions. The objective of concurrency control is to maximize transaction throughput while ensuring data integrity. Concurrency control uses techniques such as locking to manage concurrent access and prevent issues like lost updates, uncommitted dependencies, and non-repeatable reads.
○
The Two-Phase Locking (2PL) protocol is a common method to ensure that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
●
Recovery Management:
○
Recovery management is the process of restoring a database to a consistent state after a failure.
○
This involves using tools such as logs, checkpoints, and backups to recover from failures.
○
Recovery ensures that no data is lost due to system crashes or other failures.
●
Transaction Design:
○
Proper transaction design is crucial for performance.
○
Design decisions include determining transaction boundaries, managing hot spots (frequently accessed data), and setting isolation levels.
○
A key goal in transaction design is to minimize the duration of transactions.
●
Examples of Transactions:
○
Making an airline reservation.
○
Withdrawing cash from an ATM.
○
Placing an order in an online shopping system.
○
Registering for a course.
Transaction processing is fundamental to the daily operations of many organizations, including banks, airlines, and universities, and its importance is continually growing with the rise of electronic commerce and mobile computing.
Transaction processing is also contrasted with business intelligence processing, which utilizes data warehouses with historical data to support strategic decision-making, while transaction processing relies on operational databases with current data at the individual level for daily operations.
