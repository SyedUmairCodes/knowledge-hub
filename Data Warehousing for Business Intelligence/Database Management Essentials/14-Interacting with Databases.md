Different users interact with databases in various ways, depending on their roles and needs within an organization. These interactions can be broadly categorized into those of functional users and information systems professionals. Functional users interact with databases as part of their daily work, while information systems professionals are involved in the design and implementation of databases.
Here are the different ways users interact with databases:
●
Functional Users: These users interact with databases as part of their daily tasks. They can be further classified into:
○
Indirect Users: These users have a passive role, receiving reports or data extracted from a database without directly interacting with it.
○
Parametric Users: These users are more active, requesting existing forms or reports by using parameters that change from usage to usage. For example, a user might specify a date range or sales territory to generate a report.
○
Power Users: These are the most active functional users, skilled enough to build their own reports and perform ad hoc queries. They require a good understanding of non-procedural access methods, such as SQL.
○
Examples: A financial analyst might be a power user, using database tools to extract and analyze financial data, while a customer service representative might be a parametric user, looking up customer information through a pre-built form.
●
Information Systems Professionals: These users interact with databases as part of developing and maintaining information systems. They include:
○
Analyst/Programmers: They are responsible for collecting requirements, designing applications, and implementing information systems. They create and use external views to develop forms and reports. Analyst/programmers need a good understanding of database and application development.
○
Database Administrators (DBAs): DBAs assist both information systems professionals and functional users. They have both technical and non-technical responsibilities. Their technical tasks include database design, while their non-technical roles involve tasks like consulting with users, managing security, planning new databases, and monitoring performance. DBAs have detailed knowledge of individual database management systems (DBMSs).
○
Data Administrators (DAs): DAs have a management role, with broader responsibilities than DBAs. DAs plan the development of new databases, control the usage of data throughout an organization, and set data policies. They use data resources in a broad context, considering both traditional business data and unstructured data. DAs focus on planning and policy setting, while DBAs focus on individual databases and DBMSs.
○
Management: Management has an oversight role in the development of databases and information systems.
●
Interactions Based on Access:
○
Non-procedural access: This allows users to specify the parts of a database to retrieve without needing to know the implementation details. The Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard tool for non-procedural access. Non-procedural access improves software productivity and allows users with limited computing skills to interact with databases.
○
Procedural Language Interface: This allows users to combine non-procedural access with the full capabilities of a programming language, useful for complex applications. For example, Oracle has PL/SQL.
●
Organizational Roles:
○
Users can interact with databases in a functional area of a business (e.g., accounting or marketing) or in the information technology area.
○
Roles can be specialized in large organizations or more diverse in small organizations.
○
Users can have a mix of people and technical skills, or be more focused on one or the other.
●
Examples of User Interactions:
○
A student using a university database to register for courses.
○
A customer using a water utility database to check their bills.
○
A physician using a hospital database to review patient records.
○
A clerk using an accounting system to record transactions.
In summary, the interactions with databases vary from passive roles, like receiving reports, to active roles, like designing and implementing database systems. Functional users interact with the database as part of their daily jobs, while information systems professionals work to develop and maintain the database and related applications. Database administrators and data administrators are responsible for the management of data and databases within an organization. These varied interactions underscore the importance of databases in modern organizations.
