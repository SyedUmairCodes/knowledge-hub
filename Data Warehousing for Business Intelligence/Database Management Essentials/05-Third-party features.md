# Third-Party Features
Third-party software provides additional features that extend the capabilities of Database Management Systems (DBMS). These features can enhance database functionality in various ways, sometimes competing directly with the tools provided by the DBMS vendor.

Many third-party vendors offer advanced design tools that enhance the database definition and tuning capabilities already provided by DBMSs. These tools might offer features for creating sophisticated diagrams, performing detailed analysis, and generating documentation for a database design. 

Visio Professional is a third-party tool that can be used for database design. CASE (Computer-Aided Software Engineering) tools are used to help with database development, with front-end tools for diagramming and back-end tools for generating code and prototypes. Aqua Data Studio is another example of a commercial CASE tool.

Third-party vendors also provide application development tools that can be used instead of the tools provided by the DBMS. This allows organizations to select the application development tools that best suit their needs, potentially offering more advanced features or easier-to-use interfaces.

Third-party software can offer features that go beyond the standard capabilities of a DBMS. This can include specialized tools for tasks like data integration, data quality, or data warehouse management.

- Third-party software often provides specialized tools for specific tasks such as database design, performance tuning, and application development.
- In some instances, third-party software can compete directly with the database product, offering alternative tools for functions such as application development.
- Third-party data modeling tools offer capabilities for creating diagrams and models of the database.

Some third-party tools extend database tuning capabilities. By providing these diverse tools and features, third-party vendors enable organizations to customize and enhance their database environments to meet specific requirements. Third-party software extends the features available with the database software and helps organizations tailor their databases to specific needs.
