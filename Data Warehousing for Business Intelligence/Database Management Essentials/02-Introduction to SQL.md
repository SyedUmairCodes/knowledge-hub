# Introduction to SQL
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is an industry-standard database language used for database definition, manipulation, and control. SQL is a non-procedural language that allows users to specify what data to access, rather than how to access it. This means that users do not need to write complex procedures with loops to retrieve data.

- SQL is designed to allow users to access data without needing to code complex procedures. Non-procedural languages, like SQL, do not include looping statements because the user specifies the parts of a database to access.
- SQL is supported by most DBMSs and is considered an industry standard.
- SQL includes statements for database definition, manipulation, and control.

SQL is used to define tables, relationships among tables, integrity constraints, and authorization rights. The CREATE TABLE statement is an example of a database definition statement. SQL statements like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE are used to manipulate data within a database. SQL has statements such as GRANT and REVOKE that are used to control access to data.

SQL is used to formulate queries, which are requests for data to answer a question. The SELECT statement is a primary tool for non-procedural database access. SQL can be used in stand-alone mode, where users submit SQL statements with a specialized editor, or in embedded mode, where SQL statements are included in a computer program.
## Evolution
SQL began as the SQUARE language in IBM's System R project, later becoming SEQUEL, and eventually SQL due to legal issues. SQL is a crucial tool for database professionals, especially power users and information systems professionals, as it enables efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Understanding SQL is fundamental to working with databases and developing database applications.
