New data is being created around us every second and data in it's rawest form isn't useful to us but if we collect and analyze data, find patterns and meanings in it the  it is more valuable then oil in our modern day and age.

## Analyzing Data
Data analysis is the process of making use of our data, that can even lead businesses in the correct direction based on how and what their users need.

The roots of data analysis go far in time as when the Egyptians started to use statistics to help them build the pyramids more  easily. The Egyptians were great when it came to organizing and documenting data, they documented all of their data and calculation theories.

## Data Life-cycle
Almost everything in the world living or non-living has a life cycle, the life cycle of data starts with planning about what data to collect and how to collect it, then comes the collection phase where data is collected in huge amounts after collection the data is then cleaned and analyzed to make sure it makes sense.
