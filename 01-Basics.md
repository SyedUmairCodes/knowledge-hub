Programming, more broadly, has helped advance humanity in so many ways, all of them driven by people writing code. The Hubble Space Telescope's images that have helped us unravel the mysteries of the universe are processed and analyzed using computer programs written by scientists. The particle accelerators that discovered the Higgs boson were only made possible because developers wrote software to analyze the data they collected in order to drive forward our understanding of physics. Our daily use of the internet, too, was made possible only through people writing computer programs. When you pick up your phone and send a message to someone else, well, you're using a computer program that someone else wrote. If you use GPS to navigate, or if you or someone you love uses assistive technology like speech recognition or eye tracking, these are technologies that have changed the lives of so many people with a disability. All of these are programs that someone wrote. At the heart of computer programming is gaining the skill to command machines to do your bidding. Computer programs are sets of precise instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Just as a cooking recipe guides you through the steps needed to consistently achieve a delicious result, a computer program provides instructions for a computer to perform a specific task. Being able to program will give you an edge in terms of what you'll be able to accomplish. I see many people using programming to automate repetitive tasks like repeatedly taking, say, PDF documents and extracting relevant data into a spreadsheet. And beyond analyzing data that you or your company may already have, programming also helps you gain brand new insights. I see many teams, including business analysts, for example, increasingly using AI tools like ChatGPT to automatically browse the web, download a bunch of web pages, and synthesize a report to help them gain market insight to learn more about what's happening in some part of the world. And as you learn to code, you better identify and automate more and more of these types of tasks using AI yourself. And it turns out that through programming, you can tell your computer to use AI tools like ChatGPT or other AI language models. By writing just a few lines of code, not you, but your computer can now also go use ChatGPT to help it carry out tasks. The whole part of writing code in this course would be to get your computer to use AI tools via Python so that it could do more for you. Most AI developers, like me, use Python pretty much all the time. And it turns out Python is actually the most popular programming language. Python has a very supportive community of developers. If you have a question, there's so many Python developers around the world. So you can often get someone to help you out or find someone that has the same question. And it turns out that chatbots like ChatGPT and Anthropics Cloud and Google's Gemini also know Python pretty well. And so they can help you out if you get stuck on a problem. So when you're programming and you have a question, I encourage you to try asking a chatbot to help you find a solution, as I'll show you in this course. Today, Python is powering tons of AI applications. Python code is running in many self-driving cars. It's using software that powers chatbots and in many other AI applications, from smart agriculture to healthcare to financial services and on and on and on. And the use of Python extends well beyond that. Many websites, smartphone applications, video games, and more are run using Python.
