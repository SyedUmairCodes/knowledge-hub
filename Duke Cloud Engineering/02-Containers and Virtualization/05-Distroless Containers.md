# Distroless Containers
Distroless containers are like a simple, healthy meal consisting of only rice and beans. Just as rice and beans provide complete nutrition with minimal ingredients, distroless containers aim to include only the absolute essentials needed to run your application. This results in a container image that is smaller, more secure, and easier to manage.

## Key Advantages

- Distroless images prioritize minimizing the amount of software included in the container.
- By eliminating unnecessary software, distroless containers reduce the potential attack surface.
- Fewer components mean fewer things can go wrong. Distroless containers simplify dependency management and troubleshooting.
- Distroless images promote consistency and reproducibility in application deployments. Because they contain a minimal set of well-defined components.
- While the term "distroless" might sound restrictive, these containers support applications written in various programming languages.
