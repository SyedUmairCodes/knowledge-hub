# Google cloud functions
Google Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment offered by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Similar to AWS Lambda, it allows you to build and run small, self-contained applications without managing servers.

Google Cloud Functions enables you to run code in response to events or HTTP requests. This event-driven nature makes it well-suited for creating microservices that perform specific tasks when triggered. You can write code for your micro-service as a function, deploying it to Google Cloud Functions. 

Google Cloud Functions supports several programming languages, including Python, Node.js, Go, Java, and .NET, providing flexibility in choosing the language that best suits your project.

## Triggers
These functions can be triggered in multiple ways, demonstrating their flexibility:
- An HTTP trigger allows you to expose your function as a web service, accessible via an HTTP endpoint.
- Google Cloud Functions can respond to various events within the GCP ecosystem.
- You can also directly invoke Google Cloud Functions from the command line using the `gcloud` command-line tool.

# AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It enables you to run code without provisioning or managing servers, making it an ideal platform for building and deploying microservices.

With AWS Lambda, you don't need to worry about server infrastructure. You only need to upload your code, and Lambda takes care of everything else required to run and scale it. This aligns perfectly with the serverless computing paradigm, allowing you to focus solely on your code.

AWS Lambda seamlessly integrates with other AWS services. You can trigger Lambda functions from various sources like API Gateway (for HTTP requests), S3 (for file uploads), DynamoDB (for database changes), and more. This interoperability allows you to build complex workflows and event-driven architectures.

AWS Lambda functions are well-suited for implementing microservices because they can be designed to perform specific, isolated tasks. You can create individual Lambda functions for different functionalities within your application, promoting a modular and maintainable architecture. 

AWS Lambda supports various programming languages, including Python, Node.js, Java, Go, and others, giving you the flexibility to use the language that best fits your project's needs and your team's expertise.

You pay only for the compute time that your Lambda functions consume. This can result in significant cost savings, especially for applications with intermittent or unpredictable traffic patterns, as you are not charged when your code is not running.

# Comparing Platforms

While both AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions are serverless computing platforms designed for running code without server management, there are some key differences between them.
