# AWS Cloud Shell
AWS CloudShell is a browser-based, pre-configured command-line environment that allows you to interact with AWS services without the need to manage your own server or install software.

CloudShell eliminates the hassle of setting up your local development environment. This is particularly useful for quick tasks, experimentation, or when you need immediate access to the AWS CLI. It comes with the AWS CLI, tools for languages like Python (including virtual environment management), and common utilities like vi (a text editor) already set up.

You also get a small amount of persistent storage, which allows you to store scripts, configuration files, and small projects that persist across sessions. 

## Use cases

- Creating and listing DynamoDB tables.
- Managing ECR repositories.
- Managing AWS cloud infrastructure.
- Etc...

# GCP Cloud Shell

Google Cloud Shell, similar to AWS CloudShell, provides a convenient way to interact with Google Cloud Platform resources directly from your web browser. 

You get a command-line interface with pre-installed tools and utilities, eliminating the need for local setup and configuration. 

GCP Cloud Shell can function as a lightweight, integrated development environment. You can edit code using the built-in code editor, manage Git repositories, and run and test your code all within the Cloud Shell environment. GCP Cloud Shell comes with common programming languages (Python, Rust) and tools like git for version control pre-installed.

## Use cases

- Managing and creating cloud resources.
- Managing IAM and user policies.
- Managing cloud storage buckets.
- Etc...
