# Load Testing
Load testing is a crucial practice for businesses with customer-facing applications, particularly Software as a Service (SaaS) providers, gaming companies, and those with consumer-facing products. It helps determine an application's limits by simulating real-world user traffic and identifying potential bottlenecks before they impact actual users.

Similar to stress testing physical infrastructure like bridges, load testing subjects applications to high-stress conditions to understand their breaking points and ensure they can handle expected traffic loads without failure.

By identifying performance bottlenecks and vulnerabilities early on, load testing helps avoid costly downtime, performance degradation, and negative user experiences in a live environment. Load testing helps uncover complex and subtle issues that might not surface under normal conditions. It allows developers to reproduce specific failure scenarios, making it easier to diagnose and fix the root causes of problems.


## Load Testing a Flask App with Locust
Locust is specifically designed for load testing and can simulate a large number of concurrent users interacting with your application. It's known for its ability to handle millions of simultaneous users, making it suitable for testing the scalability and performance of web applications like your Flask app.

>[!info]
>Locust is written in Python, which makes it easy to integrate into your Flask development workflow, as Flask itself is also a Python framework.

- Install locust in your flask app environment.
- Create a `locustfile.py` file in your project folder.
- Define the behavior and tasks you want to load test.
- Run the test and monitor the results.

```python
from locust import HttpUser, task, between

class WebsiteUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 5)  # Simulate pauses between user actions

    @task
    def get_hello_world(self):
        self.client.get("/")
```
