# Introduction
Micro-services are small, independent services that perform specific tasks within a larger application. They are a popular choice for building cloud-native applications, and they offer several advantages over traditional monolithic architectures.

A micro-service is designed to do one thing well. This makes it easier to understand, develop, and maintain than a large, monolithic application. Micro-services operate independently and don't rely on other services to function. Each micro-service can connect to the database, authentication system, or other services independently.

Each micro-service is designed for a specific task and can handle errors gracefully, even if other services fail. This isolation and resilience improve the overall stability of the application.

## Benefits of Micro-services
- Micro-services' small size and clear purpose simplify development. Developers can quickly understand and modify individual services without navigating through large codebases.
- Micro-services break down complex applications into manageable units, making the system easier to understand, test, and maintain.
- Micro-services operate independently, the failure of one service is less likely to cascade and affect others.

# Serverless Micro-services
Serverless microservices represent a powerful convergence of two important concepts in modern software development, micro-services and serverless computing.

## Benefits of Serverless Micro-services
 
 - Developers can deploy individual microservices without worrying about server provisioning, operating systems, or scaling infrastructure.
 - In a serverless model, you typically pay only for the actual execution time of your functions. 
 - Serverless platforms automatically scale your functions up or down based on demand.
 - Serverless computing can accelerate development by allowing developers to focus on writing code and deploying small, independent units of functionality quickly.
