# Monitoring
Monitoring is a critical function of operations, especially for customer-facing businesses. It involves keeping track of resources and applications to ensure optimal performance and business continuity. Effective monitoring allows you to identify and address issues before they impact your users.

Monitoring should focus on tracking meaningful metrics that provide insights into the health and performance of your applications. This may include metrics such as latency, error rates, resource utilization, and traffic patterns.

While alerts are essential for notifying teams about potential problems, it's crucial to ensure they are actionable and rare. An overabundance of non-actionable alerts can lead to alert fatigue and desensitize teams to genuine issues.

Effective monitoring provides valuable insights into your application's health, performance, and user experience. By tracking the right metrics, setting up actionable alerts, and continuously improving your monitoring system, you can identify and address issues proactively, minimize downtime, and ensure a seamless experience for your users.

## Alerts
Alerts are a crucial component of monitoring in cloud computing. They act as notifications, alerting you to potential issues or specific conditions within your cloud infrastructure or applications. Alerts help ensure the health, performance, and availability of your systems.

Alerts exist to notify you of potential problems that need attention. This could range from infrastructure issues like server outages to application-specific problems like exceeding resource limits. 

It's crucial that alerts are actionable, meaning they provide enough information for you to take appropriate action. Avoid setting up alerts that result in unnecessary notifications or don't offer clear steps for resolution.

Cloud platforms offer flexibility in configuring alerts. You can tailor them to specific metrics, thresholds, and notification methods. For example, you can set up alerts based on memory usage for your microservices on Google App Engine.

## Prometheus
Prometheus is a popular open-source system used for collecting metrics from applications and infrastructure and setting up alerts based on those metrics. It's particularly well-suited for dynamic and containerized environments.

Prometheus primarily functions as a time-series database, collecting metrics from various sources over time. These metrics are typically numerical values that represent the state or performance of a system or application (e.g., CPU usage, request latency, error rates).

Unlike some monitoring systems that rely on agents to push metrics to a central server, Prometheus uses a pull-based model. It periodically scrapes (fetches) metrics data from configured targets, which expose these metrics through a standardized format.

Various client libraries are available for different programming languages, making it easier to instrument your applications to expose Prometheus-compatible metrics. This integration is essential for Prometheus to collect data effectively.
