# Introduction to Flask
Flask is a popular and lightweight Python web framework, often used for building micro-services. It simplifies the process of creating web applications by providing a structure for handling requests, routing URLs, and executing code.

Flask maps Python functions to web URLs, making it straightforward to create simple yet functional web services. For example, a URL like `http://mydomain.com/name` could be mapped to a Flask route called "Name" that executes a specific piece of Python code.

Flask's lightweight nature and simplicity make it well-suited for micro-service-based architectures. Its focus on specific tasks and its ease of use align well with the principles of microservices, which aim to break down complex applications into smaller, independent units.
