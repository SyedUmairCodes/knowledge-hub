# AWS Cloudwatch
CloudWatch is a comprehensive monitoring service offered by AWS that gives you visibility into your cloud resources and applications. It enables you to collect metrics, set alarms, take automated actions, and troubleshoot issues to ensure your applications are running smoothly.

CloudWatch can be used to track the performance and health of various AWS services and your own applications running on AWS. You can configure alarms within CloudWatch to trigger notifications or automated actions based on specific metric thresholds.

CloudWatch can capture and process events, allowing you to trigger actions based on occurrences within your AWS environment. For example, you can use events to trigger a Lambda function at a specific time interval.

You can integrate CloudWatch with your applications to collect and store logs. This provides a centralized location to analyze application behavior, debug issues, and identify trends.

CloudWatch allows you to collect and track a wide variety of metrics, including those provided by AWS services and custom metrics that you define for your applications. These metrics provide insights into your application's performance, resource utilization, and overall health.
