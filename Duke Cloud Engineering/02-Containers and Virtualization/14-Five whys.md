# The Five Whys Technique
The Five Whys is an iterative, interrogative technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem. The primary goal of the Five Whys is to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question "Why?" at least five times. Each answer forms the basis of the next "Why?" question.

The Five Whys technique, like Kaizen, originated in Japan around the same time period. It was initially used in the manufacturing industry, particularly by Toyota, as part of their problem-solving methodology.

The process starts with defining a problem clearly. Then, the question "Why?" is asked repeatedly, with each answer leading to the next question. The sources emphasize that you should ask "Why?" _at least_ five times to get to the root cause.

In essence, the Five Whys method is a straightforward yet powerful tool for problem-solving. By encouraging deeper analysis and promoting a focus on root causes, it empowers teams to make informed decisions and implement effective, lasting solutions.
