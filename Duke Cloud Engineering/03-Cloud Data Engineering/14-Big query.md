# BigQuery
BigQuery is a data warehouse tool in the Google Cloud platform. It can be used to explore data, compose queries, add data, upload local files, and use public datasets. BigQuery offers various ways to interact with datasets, including the ability to view the dataset's metadata, such as its last modified date and a description of the data.

One can toggle through various nodes of the dataset, see its sections, and select fields to automatically generate a query. For example, selecting the "term" field within a Google Trends dataset would generate a query showing the top search terms.

BigQuery enables users to format queries, save them for future use, and reuse them on a regular basis, beyond SQL queries, BigQuery integrates with other tools for more in-depth data analysis. 

Data can be explored through spreadsheets, Colab Notebooks, and Looker Studio, providing a comprehensive solution for exploratory data analysis.  Looker Studio allows for querying different fields and terms, creating visualizations, and sharing insights with others.

> BigQuery also offers the capability to explore and combine data from various public datasets, such as Google Trends and Hacker News.
