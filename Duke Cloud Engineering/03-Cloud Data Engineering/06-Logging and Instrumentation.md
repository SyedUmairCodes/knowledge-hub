# Logging
Logging and instrumentation are essential for understanding and managing the complexities of distributed systems, especially in cloud environments.  Without them, it becomes nearly impossible to gain insights into the system's behavior, identify potential issues, or effectively debug problems.

> They serve as the equivalent of "data science for software engineering," providing the data necessary to monitor, analyze, and optimize the performance of a distributed system.

Logging involves recording events and messages generated by different components of the system. This information can be used to track the flow of execution, identify errors, and understand user behavior.  Instrumentation focuses on collecting metrics that reflect the system's performance and health. This data includes CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, network traffic, and other relevant indicators.

Dashboards that visualize these metrics provide engineers with real-time insights into the system's state, enabling them to detect anomalies and potential bottlenecks. Centralizing logs from all nodes in a distributed system is crucial for effective monitoring and troubleshooting. This centralized view allows engineers to correlate events across different parts of the system, identify patterns, and pinpoint the root causes of problems that might span multiple nodes.
