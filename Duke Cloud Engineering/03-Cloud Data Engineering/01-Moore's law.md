# Moore's Law

>The speed of processors would double approximately every 18 months.

This held true for a long time, but changes in technology have brought about the end of Moore's law. One way to understand this is to look at the growth of single program speed over the last 40 years. 

In the 1980s, there was a 22% increase in speed. With the advent of the RISC processor, the increase jumped to 52%. Growth then slowed to 23% around 2003 with the introduction of multi-core machines. Multi-core machines are not as efficient at scaling, leading to diminishing returns due to the end of Moore's law.

Currently, the increase in single program speed is only about 3%. This slowdown creates both problems and opportunities. One way people are taking advantage of the end of Moore's law is to look at ASICs, or application specific integrated circuits.

ASICs are chips designed for a specific purpose, unlike CPUs, which are designed for many different tasks.  A good example of an ASIC is a GPU, or graphics processing unit, which is designed specifically for parallel processing, making it ideal for graphics programming.
