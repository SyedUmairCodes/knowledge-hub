# Concurrency in Python
The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python limits concurrency by locking threads to a single core. This limitation stems from Python's early development during a time when multi-core machines were not common.

While the GIL doesn't pose a problem on single-core machines,it becomes a significant bottleneck on multi-core systems, hindering the effective utilization of available processing power. This limitation makes Python a less suitable choice for building servers that require high levels of concurrency to handle numerous requests efficiently.
