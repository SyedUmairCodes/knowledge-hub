# Big data
Big data is a concept that goes beyond simply having a large dataset. If you can work with the data on your laptop, you are not dealing with big data.

- **Size:** Big data is so large that it cannot be efficiently stored, processed, or analyzed on a typical laptop. The data requires specialized infrastructure and tools designed for distributed computing.
- **Tools:** Traditional data analysis tools, such as Pandas in Python, are designed for smaller datasets and often require significant RAM, making them unsuitable for big data. Specialized tools like Spark or Athena, which distribute the workload across multiple machines, are necessary to handle big data effectively.
- **Infrastructure:** Big data requires robust infrastructure, often leveraging cloud computing platforms like AWS, to provide the storage capacity, processing power, and network bandwidth needed for efficient analysis.

## The 5 V's of Big data
 
- **Volume:** The sheer size of the data.
- **Velocity:** The speed at which the data is generated and processed.
- **Variety:** The different types of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
- **Veracity:** The accuracy and trustworthiness of the data. 
- **Value:** The insights and business value that can be derived from the data.
