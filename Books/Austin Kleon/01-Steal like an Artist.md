# Steal like an Artist
Creative people don't magically have ideas from anywhere, they steal them from others who have stolen them for someone else. Nothing is original, everything is a copy of another copy, and sometimes it's a copy of multiple things at once.

All creators have a mentor, who guides them, teaches them, and shows them how to become better at their art. Whenever your mentor gives you advice, know that this is the advice he wanted when he was in your place.

Be curious, read, research, Google everything that comes to your mind, and create things that you like so that your true creativity can grow and bloom. When you hit a roadblock or get tired, rest, do something else, and recharge your batteries for the next round.

Don’t go on a hoarding spree and collect every piece of information that you can find. Only select those that resonate with you, always have a method of capturing information with you at all times. Steal from people all at once, then combine all of that into your unique version.

Challenge yourself to improve, expand your network, engage in various activities, and step outside your comfort zone to ignite your creativity. Living consistently outside your comfort zone might trigger feelings of imposter syndrome, making you question your worth and tempting you to retreat to what feels safe. However, don’t let those feelings overwhelm you. If you encounter something you don’t understand, keep pushing through until you learn.

Social media and the internet have connected people across the globe. Share your work on the platforms where others with similar interests gather, and they will share theirs in return. Build a community of like-minded individuals to inspire each other. Share anything you find interesting with your community to foster further engagement.
