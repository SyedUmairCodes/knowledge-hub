# Types of Algorithms
Data-intensive algorithms are specifically designed to handle vast quantities of data, often much larger than the available memory on a single processing unit. They typically involve simpler processing steps compared to compute-intensive algorithms, and they often rely on iterative approaches to process data in manageable chunks.

Compute-intensive algorithms involve complex and computationally demanding operations, even if they don't necessarily handle large datasets. Efficient use of processing power and potentially parallel processing strategies are critical for these algorithms.

Algorithms that are both data and compute-intensive face the dual challenge of handling massive datasets while also performing computationally demanding operations. This category demands a careful balance of efficient data management and processing power.

## Distinguishing Between the Types
The key distinction lies in the balance between the volume of data processed and the complexity of the computations performed. Data-intensive algorithms prioritize handling massive datasets efficiently. Compute-intensive algorithms prioritize complex calculations, even on smaller datasets.

Combined algorithms must address both challenges effectively. Understanding these distinctions is crucial when designing algorithms because it guides choices about data storage, processing techniques, and infrastructure requirements.

## Case scenarios
When evaluating an algorithm's time complexity, it's essential to consider that its performance can vary significantly depending on the input data

### Best case
The best-case scenario represents the most favorable arrangement of input data, leading to the algorithm's fastest possible execution time. Consider a searching algorithm that aims to find a specific value in a list. If the value happens to be the first element in the list, the algorithm would find it in a single step.

While the best case provides an optimistic upper bound on performance, it's often not a realistic representation of an algorithm's typical behavior.

### Worst Case
The worst-case scenario analyzes the algorithm's behavior with the least favorable input data, resulting in the maximum possible execution time. In our searching algorithm example, the worst case would occur if the target value is at the very end of the list or not present at all. The algorithm would have to examine every single element, leading to the longest possible runtime.

### Average Case
The average case aims for a more realistic performance estimate by considering a range of possible input scenarios and their likelihood of occurrence. Categorize different input data arrangements based on their characteristics and complexity.

Select a typical input from each group and analyze the algorithm's performance with that input. Determine the average execution time across all the representative inputs, weighted by the probability of each group occurring.
