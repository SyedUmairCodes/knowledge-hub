# Validating Algorithms
Validating an algorithm is a critical step in the algorithm development process. It's not enough to design an algorithm that theoretically solves a problem; you must also confirm that it functions correctly and produces the desired outcomes in practice.

Validation primarily aims to verify that the algorithm produces the expected results for a wide range of input values, including typical cases and, importantly, edge cases that test boundary conditions.

## Validation techniques

- **Deterministic Algorithms:** These algorithms produce the same output for a given input every time they are executed. Validation for deterministic algorithms typically involves systematic testing with various input values and comparing the output against the expected results.
- **Randomized Algorithms:** These algorithms incorporate random numbers as part of their logic, leading to potentially different outputs for the same input across multiple runs. Validating randomized algorithms often involves statistical analysis of the results over many runs to ensure they converge towards the desired solution within acceptable probabilities.
- **Exact Algorithms:** These algorithms aim to produce precise solutions without relying on approximations. Validation of exact algorithms focuses on verifying that the output perfectly matches the correct answer for all possible inputs.
- **Approximate Algorithms:** These algorithms employ simplifications or assumptions to reduce complexity, potentially sacrificing some accuracy. Validating approximate algorithms centers around assessing the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. You need to define acceptable error thresholds and confirm that the algorithm's results consistently fall within these boundaries.
## Validation Steps

- **Define Clear Expectations:** Before validation, explicitly state the expected outcomes for various input scenarios, including typical cases and edge cases.
- **Test with Diverse Data:** Use a comprehensive dataset that represents the real- world data the algorithm will encounter, encompassing a wide range of values and potential outliers.
- **Consider Different Input Conditions:** Evaluate the algorithm's performance under best-case, worst-case, and average-case input scenarios to assess its robustness and potential range of efficiency.
- **Analyze Results Systematically:** Don't just check if the output looks reasonable. Compare the algorithm's output against known correct solutions or use statistical measures to quantify its accuracy and error rates.
- **Document the Validation Process:** Keep detailed records of the validation procedures, datasets used, and results obtained. This documentation provides evidence of the algorithm's reliability and can be invaluable for future audits or improvements.
