Defining Data Science: Data science is defined as using data to answer questions, and it is a broad field involving statistics, computer science, mathematics, data cleaning, formatting, and visualization1. A data scientist combines software programming, statistics, and storytelling skills to extract valuable information from data1.

●

The Rise of Data Science: The rise of data science is attributed to the vast amount of available data, inexpensive computing, and the development of tools for data analysis1.

●

Big Data: Big data is characterized by three qualities: volume (large datasets), velocity (rapid data generation), and variety (different types of data, structured and unstructured)1.

●

What is Data?: Data is defined as information, especially facts or numbers collected to be examined and used for decision-making2. Data is also defined as a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables2. Qualitative data describes qualities, while quantitative data describes quantities2.

●

Data Sources: The document notes that data often comes in messy formats2. Examples of messy data include: sequencing data, census data, and electronic medical records2. Images and videos are also data sources that can be analyzed2. It emphasizes that a good data scientist asks questions first and seeks out relevant data second2.

●

Skills of a Data Scientist: A data scientist needs substantive expertise, hacking skills (computer programming), and math and statistics knowledge1. The document focuses on teaching math, statistics, and hacking skills, specifically with the programming language R1.

●

Problem Solving: The ability to solve problems is essential for a data scientist3. The document provides strategies for getting help with problems, including: reading manuals, searching online, and using forums34. It also covers strategies for dealing with coding errors4. The document also recommends trying rubber duck debugging, which involves explaining the problem to a person or object4.

●

Asking for Help: When seeking help, it's important to ask specific questions, include details of your troubleshooting, and follow forum etiquette56. This includes being courteous and following up with solutions to your posted question6.

●

The Data Science Project Process: The document outlines the steps in a data science project: forming a question, finding data, analyzing the data, and communicating the results7. An example of a data science project is provided where Hilary Parker analyzed baby name popularity data7. The example shows how a question is asked, data is collected and analyzed, and the results are communicated through a blog post7.

●

Examples of Data Science Projects: The document mentions other examples of data science projects including predicting opioid overdoses using R, and projects relating to weather preference, Trump's tweets and sexual health clinic locations7.
